# Finance

This repository is used to create access to the finance database using the following technology stack:

1. PostgresQL database
2. SQLAlchemy ORM (Python)
3. Pythong
4. Flask/Jinga (WSGI)

SQLAlchemy is used to abstract the physical database from the main application which is written in Python.   The models are exposed to the application via the models.py file.
